               Number of seconds to wait for agent's reply to a request.

               Nova configures/performs certain administrative actions on a
               server with the help of an agent that's installed on the server.
               The communication between Nova and the agent is achieved via
               sharing messages, called records, over xenstore, a shared
               storage across all the domains on a Xenserver host.
               Operations performed by the agent on behalf of nova are:
               'version',' key_init', 'password','resetnetwork','inject_file',
               and 'agentupdate'.

               To perform one of the above operations, the xapi 'agent' plugin
               writes the command and its associated parameters to a certain
               location known to the domain and awaits response. On being
               notified of the message, the agent performs appropriate actions
               on the server and writes the result back to xenstore.
               This result is then read by the xapi 'agent' plugin to
               determine the success/failure of the operation.

               This config option determines how long the xapi 'agent' plugin
               shall wait to read the response off of xenstore for a given
               request/command. If the agent on the instance fails to write
               the result in this time period, the operation is considered to
               have timed out.

               Number of seconds to wait for agent't reply to version request.

               This indicates the amount of time xapi 'agent' plugin waits
               for the agent to respond to the 'version' request specifically.
               The generic timeout for agent communication ``agent_timeout``
               is ignored in this case.

               During the build process the 'version' request is used to
               determine if the agent is available/operational to perform
               other requests such as 'resetnetwork', 'password', 'key_init'
               and 'inject_file'. If the 'version' call fails, the other
               configuration is skipped. So, this configuration option can
               also be interpreted as time in which agent is expected to be
               fully operational.

                The use of XenAPI agent can be disabled altogether using the
                configuration option ``disable_agent``. However, if it is not
                disabled, the use of an agent can still be controlled by the

                Note that if this configuration is set to ``True`` when the
